# C -:page_with_curl: Sorting algorithms & Big O

## About this project:
In this project I learnt and practiced;
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

I went ahead to implement 12 different sorting algorithms in 12 files.

## Tasks file descriptions:

all types and functions written for the 12 tasks in this peoject.

and functions written for the ask `1000-sort_deck.c`.

* [print_array.c](./print_array.c): C function that prints an array of
integers as a helper function for the sorting functions

* [print_list.c](./print_list.c): C function that prints a `listint_t`
doubly-linked list as a helper function for the sorting functions.

  * [0-bubble_sort.c](./0-bubble_sort.c): C function that sorts an array of integers
  in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
  * Prints the array after each swap.

  complexities of the Bubble Sort algorithm, one per line.

  * [102-counting_sort.c](./102-counting_sort.c): C function that sorts an array
  of integers in ascending order using the Counting Sort algorithm.
  * Assumes that the array will only contain numbers `>= 0`.
  * Prints the counting array after it has been initialized.
  * [102-O](./102-O): Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time
  complexities of the Counting Sort algorithm, one per line.

  * [103-merge_sort.c](./103-merge_sort.c): C function that sorts an array of integers in
  ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.
  * Implements the `top-down` Merge Sort algorithm.
    * When an array is divided, the size of the left subarray is always less than
    or equal to the size of the right subarray.
    * Always sorts the left subarray before the right one.
  * Prints subarrays each time they are merged.
  * [103-O](./103-O): Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time
  complexities of the Merge Sort algorithm, one per line.

  in ascending order using the Heap Sort algorithm.
  * Implements the `sift-down` Heap Sort algorithm.
  * Prints the array after each swap.
  * [104-O](./104-O): Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time
  complexiites of the Heap Sort algorithm, one per line.

  * [105-radix_sort.c](./105-radix_sort.c): C function that sorts an array of
  integers in ascending order using the Radix Sort algorithm.
  * Implements the Least-Significant-Digit (LSD) Radix Sort algorithm.

  * Assumes that `size` is a power of 2 (ie. `size` can be expressed as `2^k`
  where `k >= 0`).
  * Prints subarrays each time they are merged.
  * [106-O](./106-O): Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time
  complexities of the Bitonic Sort algorithm, one per line.
